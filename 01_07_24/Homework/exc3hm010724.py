#Write a flowchart where we put 777 into int (x) and then put 888 into int (y) and then  -999 to (int)z.
# Considered to int (result) the results calculation z+y*x. Print result.
#Start
x = 777;
print("x is equal to ", x);
y = 888;
print("y is equal to ", y);
z = -999;
print("z is equal to ", z);
operation = (z+y)*x;
print("The result for z+y*x is: ", operation);
#End
