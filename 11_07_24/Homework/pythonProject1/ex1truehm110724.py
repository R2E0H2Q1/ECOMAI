#Thus, one should choose appropriate values for each exercise length â€“ once for a true result and once for a false result.
# Of course, in each condition, values should be chosen independently for d, c, b, a so that they lead once to true and then to appropriate values to result in false
#(each exercise's values are independent of the previous exercise).
#It is recommended to create one code file where all answers are true, and one where all answers are false. Note that for some exercises there is no solution.
# For example, for an exercise of type 'True or a if', it will always evaluate to true regardless of what we put in 'a', so there won't be an answer that returns false for this section.
