# #Prepare a list of strings, and in it insert 3 of your favorite songs or your favorite movies
# Hint:
# movies: list[str] = [ ... ]
# Now insert a song/movie at the end of the list using: append , see code from the lesson
# Now insert a song/movie to the beginning of the list using: insert , see code from the lesson
# Print the length of the list using: len, see code from the lesson
# Now create another list of integers [int[list and populate it with 10 random numbers-
# Use a for loop in the randint function and append
# Now create another boolean list [bool[list and populate it with 10 random values each value can be True or False. Use a for loop in the choice.random function and append.
# * Bonus: create a random word from the letters c, b, a - ie: draw a word length (between 5-20) and then run In a loop as long as the word - draw a letter from c b a and add it to the word.
# * Bonus: 2 upgrade the solution - create a list that will contain a random number of words, each word will be random (as in the previous section).
# That is: draw a list length (between 10-20) and then fill the list in random words of drawn length. If, for example, the number -12 was drawn, the list will contain 12 words
